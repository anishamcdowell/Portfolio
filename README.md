## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that will serve as a portfolio of my work as a web developer. While I don't have many finished projects to share at this point, the site itself is an example of my current knowledge and ability surrounding HTML and CSS. I built this page from scratch after viewing a demonstration portfolio page and aimed to focus on recreating responsive functionality with CSS Flexbox and media queries. I hope to update and expand my projects and the design of this portfolio as I continue my work in UNC Charlotte's coding bootcamp.
